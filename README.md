# Phone with Verilog
This is a term project for logic and digital system design course which I took. This implementation uses states and binary system to communicate with two people. It can also calculate the cost by sending a char. There are both compinational and sequential part in implementation. It is ready to work in FPGA device. The main_design.v file is containing Verilog code of implementation which is written by me. Test files which is test_1.v and test_2.v is not written by me, they are provided to test my code which is fully match with expected output.
